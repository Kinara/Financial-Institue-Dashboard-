## 📈 Key Insights & Business Impact

This dashboard provides critical insights that allow stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and drive strategic initiatives:

| **Customer Churn Rate** | Churn is highest among **[Age Group/Service Type]**, spiking in the last quarter. | Focus retention campaigns on these high-risk customer segments. |
| **Revenue & Profitability** | **[Product Category Name]** accounts for 65% of net profit, but requires a significant portion of service resources. | Investigate automation for service requests related to this product to maintain profitability. |
| **Geographic Performance** | The **[Region Name]** branch shows the highest average transaction value but the lowest cross-selling rate. | Develop targeted upselling training for sales teams in the **[Region Name]** branch. |
